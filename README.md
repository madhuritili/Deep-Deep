![d1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50355119-e102-4842-903d-b0f5ef9d75b3)



## 🔍 Overview  
This project utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to **automatically detect deepfake videos** by analyzing visual patterns and inconsistencies in facial features. As deepfake technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, building reliable detection systems is critical for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of digital content.

This system is designed to identify manipulated media in both **pre-recorded** and **real-time video streams**, supporting use cases in media verification, cybersecurity, digital forensics, and more.

## ✨ Features

- **🕵️ Deepfake Detection**  
  Automatically determines whether a video contains real or manipulated content by analyzing facial patterns, inconsistencies, and anomalies.

- **🧠 Pre-trained Models**  
  Incorporates advanced deep learning models (e.g., XceptionNet, MesoNet, or FaceForensics++) for high-accuracy deepfake detection.

- **⚡ Real-Time Processing**  
  Capable of analyzing and classifying video frames in real-time for quick detection.

- **📊 Visualization Tools**  
  Displays video frame predictions, confidence levels, and highlights potential tampering to assist human reviewers.

- **📁 Dataset Support**  
  Compatible with well-known datasets like [DFDC](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/dfdc), [FaceForensics++](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics), and more.
